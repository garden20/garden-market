        <h2>Uploading an app</h2>
        <p>
          If you don't already have an account on this site, you'll need to create
          one before uploading an app to the Garden. Make sure you're using Kanso
          0.1.4 or higher, then use the following command to upload your app:
        </p>
        <pre>kanso push {{upload_url}}</pre>

        <hr/>

        <h2>Required properties</h2>
        <p>
          Before uploading an app to the Garden, you need to ensure you provide
          the following properties in your <code>kanso.json</code> file.
        </p>

        <h4>Icons</h4>
        <p>
          You must supply at least four icon sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 96x96, 128x128.
          No image processing happens after you upload the app to the garden,
          you are expected to properly format and scale your icons beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Icon sizes should be normalized, so they have the same visual weight.
          For information on what makes a good icon, see the guidance on 
          <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/images.html">supplying images</a>
          from the Chrome Web Store.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{
    "attachments": ["icons", ...],
    "icons": {
        "16": "icons/app_icon_16.png",
        "48": "icons/app_icon_48.png",
        "96": "icons/app_icon_96.png",
        "128": "icons/app_icon_128.png"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "attachments": null,
        ...
    },
    ...
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> In the above example the icons are added as
          attachments before referencing the attachment paths for each icon size.
        </p>

        <h4>Categories</h4>
        <p>
          Each app must belong to at least one category (though
          preferably only one). If you're able to fit your app under an existing
          category that is much preferred to adding a new one.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{
    "categories": ["productivity"],
    ...
}</code></pre>

        <h4>Descriptions</h4>
        <p>
          Apps require two descriptions: a short one used on the listing page and
          a long one used only on the details page. Note that the short description
          appears above the long one on the details page, so don't start the long
          description by repeating the short one.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{
    "description": "This is a short description",
    "long_description": "This is a much longer description, possibly with multiple paragraphs.\n\nSeparate paragraphs with two newline characters.",
    ...
}</code></pre>

        <h4>Promotional images</h4>
        <p>
          All apps should have at least a small promotional image 210x150 pixels.
          This will be used to display your app on listings pages.
          More sizes may be added in the future.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{
    "attachments": ["images", ...],
    "promo_images": {
        "small": "images/promo_small.png"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "attachments": null,
        ...
    }
    ...
}</code></pre>
        <strong>Note:</strong> In the above example the promo images are added as
        attachments before referencing the attachment paths for each size.

        <h4>Screenshots</h4>
        <p>
          You must provide at least one screenshot with the app, though two or
          three would be better. These images will be displayed on the app details
          page and will be constrained to a 640x400 space. These images are not
          processed before displaying, so consider resizing them appropriately
          before uploading.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{
    "attachments": ["images", ...],
    "screenshots": [
        "images/screenshot1.png",
        "images/screenshot2.png",
        "images/screenshot3.png"
    ],
    "dependencies": {
        "attachments": null,
        ...
    }
    ...
}</code></pre>
        <strong>Note:</strong> In the above example the screenshots are added as
        attachments before referencing the attachment paths for each screenshot.

        <h4>Website</h4>
        <p>
          If the app has a website or GitHub repository, you may wish to add this
          to the <code>url</code> property in your <code>kanso.json</code> file.
          It will be displayed on the app detail page.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{
    "url": "https://github.com/kanso/garden"
    ...
